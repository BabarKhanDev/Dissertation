\subsection{Background}

\subsubsection{We see a lot of images}

We are constantly surrounded by imagery, on the way to work, on the internet, on TV, in stores, etc. Some of them stick out more than others, we see hundreds, if not thousands, of images a day, and yet culturally and individually we all remember the same ones.

\subsubsection{Cultural vs Individual Memorability}

Due to cultural significance an image can become memorable. The 2015 dress \cite{BBCDress2015}, a country's flag, or the 1932 image “lunch atop a skyscraper” \cite{gambino_2012}, come to mind. I would argue that the memorability of these images is tied to the culture surrounding them, not necessarily due to intrinsic properties within. The focus of this research is on the intrinsic properties within an image that make it memorable to an individual, like seeing an advert on a bus and then later recognising the same advert online.

\subsubsection{How do we measure the memorability of an image}

% What work has shown independence of memorability from viewer?
% Isola et al in 2011
% Vischema dataset experiments

It has been shown that the memorability of an image is an intrinsic property, independent from the viewer \cite{Isola2011, IsolaParikhTorralbaOliva2011, ICCV15_Khosla, isola2014memorability}. This was achieved by performing a memorability game where participants are presented with a stream of images, and on an interval shown an image that they had already seen. Most participants were able, or unable, to remember the same images.
%I need to check if this is accurate for each of those sources ^^^^%
How often an image was recognised is proportional to its memorability. %Verify%
This is taken further by Akagunduz et al. \cite{VischemaPaper} where, in a similar experiment, they measure which regions of images are memorable.

% This should be 6-8 pages long

\subsection{Memorability}

In a study by Isola et al., it was found that some images were intrinsically more memorable than others [1]. In another study by Isola et al. [11] they found that correlations between properties such as mean saturation, and the log number of objects, has less impact on the memorability score than object statistics. Categories such as: person, person sitting, and floor, were most helpful image memorability. The categories: ceilings, buildings, and mountains, were least helpful. 

In both [1, 11] they tested participants' abilities to remember specific images after repeated exposure. Their goal, similar to that of this paper, was to identify a collection of visual attributes that make images memorable, and to use those to predict the memorability of an image. Their approach was limited by the fact that the object statistics were annotated by hand, this would both make automating the process of determining image memorability impossible, and limit them from finding any abstract properties that helped/hindered memorability.

Recently, the use of deep convolutional networks [12,13] has proven exceptionally successful in image classification and object recognition. It stands to reason that a combination of these systems could perform well at this task. It could recognise which objects are within an image, and to use that to help inform how memorable the image is.

Khosla et al. [4] built on the work in [1, 11] by, instead of determining memorability of an entire image, creating a model that discovers memorability maps of individual images without human annotation. These memorability maps are able to distinguish which areas of an image are remembered, forgotten, or hallucinated. Their approach, similar to Isola et al. in [1, 11], is limited by the arbitrarily picked list of features that define memorability.

\subsection{Using Deep Learning to Predict Memorability}

Khosla et al. have created a dataset, LaMem [5], containing 60,000 annotated image and memorability pairs. They use deep learning to predict these memorability maps, this is similar to the VISCHEMA plus dataset [7], which I will be working with. In [7] the network output utilises fully connected layers which I believe is unnecessary, and may even hurt performance. More modern computer vision network structures, such as the U-Net [8] or a GAN [9], use fully convolutional networks. These maintain spatial locality which makes them less prone to overfitting, and also allows them to generalise better. Previous work in [1,4,11] relied on human annotated features, using deep learning we should be able to automate this process by learning the features from a sufficiently large dataset such as those presented in [5,7].

I propose that predicting memorability maps is an extension of image segmentation, modern machine learning has found many network architectures that would be worth exploring for this problem. Isola et al. created Pix2Pix [10], a deep learning architecture based on Conditional Adversarial Networks. It has found great success but I think that it is too powerful a network for this task, and may cause overfitting, thus a structure akin to this could prove very effective. The U-Net [8] has also found great success in image segmentation, this system however relies on the output being a classification. Something in between these two could work very well.

\subsection{Requirements Capture}

We have a dataset of images that we will aim to accurately to map onto their corresponding labels. Through learning to map these images onto their corresponding VMS labels, we hope that our system will gain a general understanding of the data, such that when another image that matches our distribution is presented, the system can accurately create a VMS label for that. Ideally our system should create accurate mappings, we can test this by using a loss function such as L1 Loss and through qualitative analysis. 

\subsection{Analysis/Design}

% Maybe here say what a GAN vs a conditional GAN is 
% The goal is to train a conditional GAN to generate the iamges in our output.
% Compare the difference between L1 and L2 loss?

I will create a deep learning image to image model that will be trained on the training data portion of the VISCHEMA PLUS dataset, it will be evaluated on the validation data portion of the dataset. The network will be trained to directly output the corresponding VMS map.

This model will be trained as a Generative Adversarial Network, this GAN will contain a generator network and a discriminator network. The Generator will be an image to image network which maps the image onto a VMS map. The Discriminator will take an image and say if it belongs to the distribution of VMS maps or not. My training loop will be composed of an image label pair being taken from the dataset, the image will be passed into a generator, and then a fake label will be produced. The Discriminator will be passed the input image and a corresponding VMS, either produced by the generator or the real one, and through backpropagation its weights will be updated depending on if it answers correctly or not. The generator will have its weights updated through backpropagation depending on if it can fool the discriminator or not. 

In the pix2pix network the Discriminator produces 2 dimmensional array of boolean values, rather than a single value, describing whether a region of the image is from the labels of the datset, or if it is generated. I will experiment to see which approach produces better results. 

% Maybe include some references to the papers on GANS? 

I will also experiment with training the network to output the composition of the image and the label, and then manually subtract the image after. Because the difference between the image and the label is much greater than the difference between the image and the image + label I suspect that this should be easier for the generator to learn the weights for. This may produce better results and is something I will experiment with, I'm not entirely convinced however because GANs have been shown to struggle when one network is much better than the other, I suspect that the discriminator would have a harder time being able to tell the difference and may make learning impossible. 

\subsection{Implementation}

I will implement this network in Python using the PyTorch machine learning framework. This is because I am familiar with it rather than it having any advantages over other existing frameworks, and the methodology that I describe should produce the same results in any programming language or framework.

\subsubsection{Network Architectures}

\textbf{Generator}: I will use a U-Net [U-Net paper] as my image to image network. The U-Net makes use of an Encoder block and a Decoder block, there are residual connections between different sections of the blocks that help to preserve image data in the decoding stage. The network has seen great success in the medical field. [U-net success paper].

\textbf{Discriminator}: I will compare two different discriminators. One such that the range is {0|1}, either real or fake. An alternative presented in [pix2pix paper] is a PatchGAN, this will produce a 2d array that clsasifies each NxN patch within an image as real or fake.

Training within a GAN is very sensitive to differences in loss between the two networks, if one performs much better than the other it can become impossible for the other to improve, therefore I will experiment with different values of the following variables:

1. The Number of layers in the Generator and Discriminator

2. The number of channels in each layer of the Generator and Discriminator

By tweaking these I should be able to create equally powerful networks. 

\subsubsection{Loss Functions}

The loss for each network is computed differently.

\textbf{Generator Loss}: When training the Generator the loss is the sum of our loss when tricking the discriminator and the pixelwise difference between our produced label and the real label. Our network will produce a fake label, Lf. 

L = MSE(D(Lf, image), 1) + L1(Lf, Lr) 

\textbf{Discriminator Loss}: When training the Discriminator the loss is calculated as the mean value of how close our prediction was to the correct answer across a fake and real label.

L = 0.5 * ( MSE(D(Lf, image), 0) + MSE(D(Lr, image), 1) ) 

In both networks the loss is computed across an entire batch of images and then the weights are adjusted with backpropagation.

When tracking the progress of the GAN the L1 loss of the produced label vs the real label can be used, as it is independent of the discriminator, and therefore should improve over time. Every epoch I will track the value of this across the validation dataset and use that to inform me about how well our network is training. It should inform me of whether the network is overfitting, underfitting, or training well. 

\subsubsection{Training Strategy}

Typical training (gradient descent steps using the loss of the output vs the label) vs GAN (Training a generator to produce the labels and a discriminator to determine if they are from the dataset or not)

Variables that I will modify:
1. Normalisation method:
a. Batch Norm
b. Layer Norm
c. Instance Norm
4. Dropout
2. Optimisation function:
a. Adam
b. SGD
c. Adagrad
d. Adadelta
3. Other Hyperparameters:
a. Learning Rate
b. Batch Size

Mention the fact that when testing it is not feasible to test every combination of these variables. Instead I will test every variation of normalisation method, pick the best, and then use that when testing for the best optimisation function, then use both of those etc. 

\subsection{Analysis/Testing}

Using all of the different combinations of parameters that I have outlined in my methodology, I will train models to map from the image set to the label set, and then I will evaluate these in multiple different ways. The most important will be the L1 loss across the validation set, this will measure the mean absolute difference between each pixel in the output of the network and the corresponding label. The smaller this number the closer the network is to achieving a direct mapping from the image set to the label set. 

I can also use the L1 loss across the training and validation sets to determine if my model has become overfit to the training data. If the L1 loss has become significantly smaller across the training dataset vs the validation dataset, this will imply that the model has become overfit to the training set, and instead of learning the general pattern of the distribution of images, it is instead memorising the mappings. This will be a useful tool during development, and will allow me to make changes to prevent it. If the L1 loss across my train and validation data is similar then it will imply that my network is able to learn a general mapping of the data. If they both stop improving it may mean that some improvements could be made by making the network more complex (either by adding more layers or adding more channels to my layers). 

I will also examine the images qualitatively, do the images look like they are the same, are there any large issues (for example the large blue blobs or yellow areas)
